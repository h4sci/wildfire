- How to query by polygons/country boundaries? Load shapefile in DB?
- Correct geo-reference system crs?
- How would different tables in postgis database be connected?
- Can R objects (which are not in the db) be used for queries?
	- pq_geometry -- is that a specific R-geo-format

- Infrastructure for working on large/global scale
	Matthias: not necessarily need more computation power (e.g. Euler cluster); set up good database first; then see what sort of calculations you want to do
